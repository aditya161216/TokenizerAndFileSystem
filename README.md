# TokenizerAndFileSystem

This repository contains two C-based systems programming projects. Both projects demonstrate low-level system design and direct manipulation of OS primitives and data structures.

---

## Projects

### 1. [Tokenizer (Mini Shell and Tokenizer)](tokenizer/)
A lightweight Unix shell implementation and command-line tokenizer.  
- **Features:** Custom shell prompt, command parsing, built-in commands, piping, redirection, and tokenizer utilities.
- See [`tokenizer/README.md`](tokenizer/README.md) for full details and usage instructions.

### 2. [NUFS: FUSE-based File System](fuse_file_system/)
A user-space file system implemented with FUSE, supporting file/directory creation, deletion, reading, writing, and custom inode/block management.
- **Features:** POSIX file operations, block-level disk emulation, hierarchical directories, and metadata management.
- See [`fuse_file_system/README.md`](fuse_file_system/README.md) for full details and usage instructions.

## About

These projects were completed with an emphasis on understanding OS abstractions, file systems, and custom data structures.  
Each subdirectory contains its own README with build and run instructions.
